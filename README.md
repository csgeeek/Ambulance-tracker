# Smart Siren (Ambulance-Tracker) 🚑

This web app assists hospitals by bridging the communication gap between Ambulance driver and hospital management especially during emergency cases. This web app successfully tracks and alerts hospital management by which delay in treatment of patient can be reduced. This could potentially save lives.

This webapp notifies hospital when an ambulance is within 3km range of a hospital. This will be very useful at times of emergency cases which assists in timely treatement of patients. This works by tracking ambulance location(coordinates) in real-time. The location stats will also be updated in realtime on hospital's display board.
